Exercise 4: Text Preprocessor

Included Files:
    * preprocess.py
    * README.txt

Running Instructions:
    1. In the directory containing preprocess.py use the command: python3 preprocess.py or
    python3 preprocess.py <mode> and the 3 valid modes are: 'keep-digits', 'keep-stops', 'keep-symbols'
    
Notes and Assumptions:
    1. Some of the function headers include a full explanation of what the function is doing. Hence, I did not include many comments in these functions since it would have been redundant.

    2. In the function analyzeCommandLine(), the return order of the 3 boolean variables is: the first one is for the function removeNonAlNum(); the second one is for the function checkNumbers(), and the third is for the function removeStopWords().
